      <h1>Design Portfolio</h1>

      <h2>CMU and Previous Experience</h2>
      <div>
        <p>My main experience working with design is through implementing provided designs/mockups into a website.</p>
        <p>Prior to CMU, I worked at Sherwin-Williams where I completed multiple website redesigns. The biggest being the careers website, which was my first lead role in a redesign. I worked directly with marketing and our UX/UI team to implement designs. This included responsive design, animations, necessary brand styling, and technical updates. This is where my interest in the design side of web development started and what inspired me to move into front-end specific work.</p>
        <p>Once joining CMU, I was tasked with the ApplyGrad redesign where I implemented designs from student studies out of HCII. While ApplyGrad is no longer being updated due to a decision to use Slate instead, I've repurposed the design considerations from that and have been applying them to the GS Audit application. You can view the style guide, wireframes, and prototypes for that below.</p>

          </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>I have also created quick, single-page apps using requirements from my coworker Dale Shanefelt. Since these needed to be spun up quickly, no official mockups exist but I'll provide static examples of those below. The calendar one lives in the GS Audit application, so I wanted to keep the design consistent with our planned rewrite designs. The data reports page is it's own thing.</p>

        </ul>
      </div>
      
      <p>In addition to my role here at CMU, I have worked on other websites on the side as well. These include portfolio websites, a wedding website, a day spa website, and themed party invites.</p>
        
      <h2>Portfolio Work</h2>
      <div>
        <p>These sites have been worked on in tandem with the designers they are for. Designs are driven from mockups and existing examples on other websites. These sites are done in a way so that the content owner has as much control as possible. Recently, this has also included the ability to control color schemes which allows for flexibility in the design rather than forcing hard-coded values.</p>

        <span>*Please note this is going through a redesign right now so there might be some kinks being worked out still.</span>
      </div>

      <h2>Wedding Website</h2>
      <div>
        <p>This site was for the two designers I worked on portfolio sites for. It was from a wedding in 2019 in which I don't have any initial designs saved from. The website itself is also not live anymore since it was just for the short period of a wedding taking place. I kept a video of the site for archival purposes in which you can see the design choices. I think it goes without saying there were mobile considerations as well, but this only shows a desktop version anyway.</p>
        <h3>Video:</h3>

      </div>
      
      <h2>Day Spa</h2> 
      <div>
        <p>This is a new project, with styling inspired from the spa's instagram and content creator. The owner isn't technical at all and the site is relatively simple so instead of static mockups, we agreed upon a working dev site to act as the mockup instead.</p>

      <h2>In Summary</h2>
      <div>
        <p>I am more than confidant in my ability to make designs come to life for a website regardless of the type of design needed. I am also comfortable contributing to designs or providing educated feedback. Whether it's color theming, animations, content structure, or details like typography, usability, and accessibility, I am more than capable of being a useful tool for any redesign project.</p>
